We are excited to announce the upcoming second **"Scaling Impact: Co-Creating a Shared Framework for Teaching AI and Machine Learning with Applications in Arctic Research"** workshop, to be held from **October 20-24, 2025**, in beautiful Santa Barbara, CA!

Building on the success of our [2024 workshop](https://cyber2a.github.io/cyber2a-course/), this highly collaborative event will bring together AI/ML practitioners, dedicated instructors, and subject matter experts. Our collective goal is to enhance and expand the existing curriculum for teaching AI/ML in Earth sciences, with a special focus on Arctic research applications. Participants will play a key role in designing an extensible framework to support AI/ML training across various course formats and learning environments.

This workshop is a unique opportunity for faculty, trainers, and researchers with an interest in AI/ML teaching in geosciences to:

- Collaboratively review, design, and create reusable AI/ML training content.
- Develop new pedagogical strategies for interdisciplinary teams.
- Foster a network of educators to build AI/ML capacity in geosciences.

**Key Details:**

- **Workshop Dates:** October 20-24, 2025
- **Location:** The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), Santa Barbara, CA
- **Application Deadline: July 14, 2025**

Travel and accommodation support is available for a limited number of participants, thanks to funding from the National Science Foundation.

**Interested in shaping the future of AI/ML education in Earth sciences?**
