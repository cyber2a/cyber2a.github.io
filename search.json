He was among the first researchers to employ coarse-resolution satellite data to exploit the time domain for studying global photosynthesis on land, determining land cover, monitoring droughts, providing famine early warning, and predicting ecologically-coupled disease outbreaks. He has also used large quantities of Landsat data to study forest condition, deforestation, and forest fragmentation in temperate, subtropical, and tropical forests; and to study glacier extent. From 2005 to 2010, he was on NASA detail to the U.S. Global Change Program where he was the co-chairperson of two Interagency Working Groups, for Observations and for Land Use and Land Cover Change. He was active in NASA’s Space Archaeology Program and has conducted ground-based radar and magnetic surveys at Troy, the Granicus River Valley, and Gordion in Turkey, with University of Pennsylvania projects working at these locations from 2001 to 2012. Since 2014, he has been active in mapping land and forest degradation and attempting to quantify arid and semi-arid woody biomass using Landsat, MODIS, and large volumes of commercial satellite data. More recently, Tucker and colleagues have mastered mapping billions of trees and converting these into carbon at tree-level using machine learning coupled to high-performance computing. https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sci/bio/compton.j.tucker\n\n\nRecording"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nEarth observation data captures the natural and built environment of our planet. It comes in different forms, from satellite images to in-situ measurements, but can be mapped into the same geometric space: the sphere of planet Earth. It can be crucial in supporting decision making in the private and public sector alike, from improving flood resilience to forecasting crop yields. But making sense of the vast amounts of Earth observation data is difficult as it is often unstructured, unlabeled and multi-modal. Neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for processing such large quantities of unstructured data but are not equipped to handle the spatial and temporal dependencies and spherical geometry of Earth observation data. In this talk, I will present a new class of neural network models purpose-built for Earth observation data: geographic location encoders. These models combine the scalability of neural networks with geospatial domain knowledge and traditional intuitions from geodesy and spatial statistics. I will highlight how location encoders can be used for fast and accurate predictive modeling on the sphere, with applications in climate modeling and species distribution modeling. I will then present means of training location encoders in the absence of labels—using globally distributed satellite imagery and contrastive self-supervised learning. The resulting pretrained location encoders produce general-purpose location embeddings that learn the natural and physical characteristics of locations around the world. These embeddings are powerful features in downstream modeling and can help tackle long-standing challenges in geospatial machine learning such as geographic distribution shift. Finally, I will outline future challenges in AI for Earth and present an ambitious goal: “digitally twinning” our planet with the support of large-scale, self-supervised learning and Earth observation data.\n\n\nDate and Time\nJune 24, 2024, 1:00 - 2:00 PM EST\n\n\nSpeaker Biography\nKonstantin Klemmer is a postdoctoral researcher at Microsoft Research New England and part of the Machine Learning and Statistics group. His research focuses on the representation of geographic phenomena in machine learning methods, particularly in neural networks. Konstantin’s recent work includes the integration of notions of spatial dependency into neural networks and the unsupervised training of location encoders that learn characteristics of a given location and can be deployed in various downstream tasks. His work is motivated by real-world challenges such as climate change and increasing urbanization, combining technical and methodological research with application and deployment studies. Konstantin has a PhD in Computer Science and Urban Science from the University of Warwick and spent time as a visiting student at NYU, as an Enrichment student at the Alan Turing Institute and as a Beyond Fellow at TUM and DLR. He also holds a Master’s in Transportation from Imperial College London and University College London. Website: https://konstantinklemmer.github.io\n\n\nRecording"

Faster insights about permafrost’s contribution to global warming will not only help inform international climate policy, it will help the 5 million people currently living in the Arctic adapt to their quickly changing landscape and reduce costs associated with infrastructure damage (estimated to be in the billions).\nPreviously, permafrost analysis could take years — even decades — and currently, we only have one-time snapshots of past permafrost thaw. But new AI models can help scientists monitor permafrost thaw monthly by analyzing massive amounts of satellite imagery data to produce seasonal forecasts.\n“Speeding up data analysis in a rapidly shifting global climate is a game changer,” says Dr. Anna Liljedahl, one of the lead scientists working on the project at Woodwell. “New geospatial projects like the one we’ll build together can help us better understand permafrost landscapes and the real-time impact of weather changes and extreme weather events.”\nLearn more about Anna’s research and other women climate scientists receiving support from Google.org"

    "text": "photo by Andreas Weith, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nThe Arctic is facing a climate crisis that’s threatening the region, its people and the rest of the world. And while solutions to this crisis are available, like many parts of the polar region, they are just out of reach.\nFor years, satellites and drones have collected an avalanche of scientific data from even the most remote and unexplored areas of the Arctic. But the problem is that there is too much information, and it’s almost impossible to interpret.\nOne Arizona State University professor hopes to change that.\nIn August, Wenwen Li and her partners were awarded a $1 million research grant to help scientists learn to use artificial intelligence to address the pending disaster in the Arctic. Li is the principal investigator on the project.\n“The problem in the Arctic is so urgent,” said Li, a data scientist trained in computer science and earth system science at ASU. “We need to resolve it as soon as we possibly can.”\n\nBig data\nLi, a professor in ASU’s School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning, describes the daunting scale of relevant scientific information as “the big data” challenge.”\nThat may be an understatement.\nNASA’s climate change data repository is expected to have 350 petabytes of data by 2030 — the equivalent of about 10 billion single-spaced typewritten pages per day. And the satellite company MaxarTechnologies has more than 125 petabytes of global imagery. (That’s comparable to the total number of letters delivered by the U.S. Postal Service in 25 years.)\nAnd that’s just part of the problem.\nAnother element is that the data gathered is often incomprehensible to the scientists that need it most.\nThe computers currently in use by the Arctic science community don’t have the capacity to secure and interpret data on that scale, and doing so is essential for them to solve the serious problems the Arctic is facing.\n“Data alone will not help,” said Li, who directs the Cyberinfrastructure and Computational Intelligence Lab on ASU’s Tempe campus. “We need the ability to analyze huge amounts of data and receive useful scientific information from it. This process needs the support of artificial intelligence. But many Arctic scientists do not have the skills needed to work with artificial intelligence.”\nLi and her partners will use the research grant to develop a cyber training program for Arctic scientists, and those from other disciplines, to access, study and ultimately interpret these complex volumes of data with the use of artificial intelligence.\nThe project, titled “Cyber 2A: CyberTraining on AI-driven Analytics for Next Generation Arctic Scientists,” runs from March 2023 through February 2026.\n“The cutting-edge methods of using artificial-intelligence-driven analytics will give Arctic scientists the opportunity to make exciting new discoveries about what is really happening in the Arctic,” Li said.\nThe undertaking is a collaboration between Arizona State University; the University of California, Santa Barbara; University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign; and the Woodwell Climate Research Center. The team is made up of experts in cyberinfrastructure, high-performance computing, artificial intelligence and Arctic science.\n\n\nThe polar problem\nSince 1979, climate change and warming throughout the Arctic are taking place at a rapid rate: four times that of other parts of the world, according to a report from the Finnish Meteorological Institute.\nAnd there is no part of the planet untouched by this warming.\nAs the ice melts throughout the 177.6 trillion square-feet of the region, there is a trickle down effect. Infrastructures once securely built on permafrost, a frozen layer of stable soil, are now sinking.\nThe unstable infrastructure impacts everything from the economy to the ability of animals — polar bears, walruses, Arctic foxes, caribou — to hunt and retain their habitat.\nAs the ice disappears, so does its reflective powers, allowing the sun’s energy to enter and be retained by the planet. The melting ice also releases methane, a greenhouse gas, that leads to more global warming. And on and on it goes until it seems that the frozen frontier may soon be facing its final years.\nPredictions in the journal Nature Climate Change say that by 2040, there will be no more ice in the Arctic. And because the Arctic plays an important role in moderating the global climate, it will have dire consequences for the rest of the planet.\nScientists, geologists and others studying these problems cannot keep up with the thaw across the global Arctic and the vast amount of unanalyzed research data associated with it. The result is that informed decisions for policymakers and quick actions are impossible to make.\n\n\nTeam takes on the challenge\nThat’s where Li and her team come in.\nThe grant will help scientists trained in AI-related analytics to accurately predict real time changes and ultimately find solutions to global warming and climate change in the Arctic.\nThe free training will be in-person, online and through a monthly webinar series and is open to both scientists and educators.\nAn Arctic-AI research network will be established for sharing ideas and resources. And all training materials will be deposited in the Arctic Data Center’s Learning Hub to ensure access to scientists, professionals and developers in the Arctic science and geoscience domains and beyond.\nInclusivity is a major part of the effort. A recruitment plan is underway to create a strong and diverse STEM research workforce providing opportunities for minorities, economically disadvantaged groups, women, members of the Arctic Indiginous community and more.\n“The cybertaining training grant will empower a new generation of Arctic researchers and leaders in utilizing all the data that is being collected across the Arctic,” said Anna Liljedahl, co-principal investigator for the project from the Woodwell Climate Research Center. “Not just a handful of data processed close to a decade after it was collected, which is how much of the science is currently operating.”\nAnd ultimately, Li and her peers hope to do their part in restoring the environmental health of a piece of the planet."

    "text": "The GeoAI Arctic Mapping Challenge dataset builds upon Yang et al. (2023) and focuses on detecting and mapping retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS)—landscape disturbances caused by permafrost thaw. For this competition, we extend and reformat the dataset into an instance segmentation benchmark, enabling participants to train models that can better delineate individual RTS features across diverse Arctic regions.\n\nWhy it matters: RTS are sensitive indicators of permafrost thaw, which releases greenhouse gases and alters Arctic landscapes. By leveraging AI, we aim to accelerate RTS detection and improve understanding of climate-driven change.\n\n\n\nThe dataset spans 7 Arctic subregions, including:\n\nCanada: Herschel Island, Horton Delta, Tuktoyaktuk peninsulas, Banks Island\nRussia: Yamal and Gydan peninsulas, Lena River, Kolguev Island\n\n\nFigure 1.

    "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) play an increasingly crucial role in Earth science teaching and research by accelerating large data analyses, data interpretation, enhancing predictive models, and making complex environmental processes more accessible to students and researchers alike. The first NSF Cyber2A workshop, held in October 2024, was designed to provide Arctic researchers who have a limited background in computer science and computing with the tools and knowledge of AI and ML.\nThe 2025 workshop will bring together AI and ML practitioners, instructors, and other experts to collaboratively improve and expand upon this curriculum while designing an extensible framework for delivering training in different course formats. The expected outcome of the workshop is a modular set of instructional materials and supporting guidance that educators can use to teach useful AI/ML techniques to environmental and geosciences researchers, and that self-motivated learners can use themselves to develop useful skills directly.

The image above shows a classic example: a headwall of exposed ice retreating upslope, releasing sediment, water, and organic carbon into surrounding landscapes and rivers. These slumps can rapidly expand over time, reshaping terrain and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions as long-frozen carbon is mobilized.

    "text": "Photo courtesy Unsplash\n\n\nAs the Arctic warms at nearly four times the global rate, permafrost – frozen ground that has remained below 0 degrees Celsius for at least two consecutive years – is thawing rapidly, causing widespread ground collapse and infrastructure damage, threatening Arctic communities and releasing carbon into the atmosphere.\nTo date, while vast amounts of high spatial and temporal resolution data has been collected, real-time analysis of permafrost thaw has been limited, far behind the speed in which data is produced.\nNew research by Wenwen Li, professor in the School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning at Arizona State University, aims to support the development of a new, open-access resource that will use satellite data and artificial intelligence technology to make it possible to track Arctic permafrost thaw in near real time.\nThe project, led by the Woodwell Climate Research Center and funded by a $5 million grant from Google.org, will use AI technology to streamline the data analysis process and make it easier to rapidly identify patterns and trends in permafrost thaw datasets that will be essential to informing climate mitigation and adaptation strategies.\n“This is an exciting era of AI and geospatial sciences,” said Li, whose research uses AI to explore new questions about the geographic world. “Leveraging them to understand the ever-changing Earth’s environment and its climate — such as Arctic warming, excessive heatwaves and increasingly occurring disasters — offers a real chance for us as a society to better combat climate change, mitigate its impacts and plan for a more sustainable and resilient future.”\nThe three-year effort — an expansion of the Permafrost Discovery Gateway — will focus on building automated workflows for geospatial product creation, AI models capable of identifying changes, patterns and trends, and environmental and climatic drivers. It will also focus on building tera to petabyte scale permafrost thaw datasets.\n“Timely tracking of permafrost thaw is critical to assessing impacts and informing action, but current limitations in technology, combined with the rapid pace of change in Arctic landscapes, have held us all back,” said Anna Liljedahl, Woodwell Climate associate scientist and project lead. “This project will be groundbreaking in speeding up data analysis and unlocking completely new technological capabilities in how we do science in swiftly evolving landscapes, and, ultimately, what science itself can do.”\nIn particular, the technology will enable scientists, decision-makers, community members, and other interested groups and individuals to:\n• Explore permafrost thaw features that formed during the previous month.\n• Check out seasonal forecasts of permafrost thaw.\n• Predict disturbance events based on weather forecasts.\n• Estimate carbon and infrastructure loss from abrupt permafrost thaw.\n• Analyze the shape and size of permafrost thaw features and their patterns across the landscape over time.\nThis resource will also be applicable beyond the scope of permafrost thaw, enabling experts to adapt this technology for other research areas and expand access to key climate data and actionable insights across a range of issues and regions of the world.\n“It is truly wonderful to have the opportunity to work with a multi-institutional team of experts in Arctic science, cyberinfrastructure, big data, high-performance computing, remote sensing and AI,” said Li, who also is the research director of ASU’s Spatial Analysis Research Center.\n“Understanding change in the Arctic is a complex scientific problem, and we need team science to tackle this challenge,” Li said. “Our ASU team has collaborated with many of these partners in the past, and I look forward to working together to create exciting new science through this Google.org project.”\nThe research is being conducted in partnership with Woodwell Climate Research Center; University of Connecticut; University of California Santa Barbara; National Center for Supercomputing Applications; Arizona State University; Alfred Wegener Institute; University of Alaska, Fairbanks; and Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium.\nMaddie Rocklin with the Woodwell Climate Research Center contributed to this article.\nTop photo courtesy Unsplash"

    "text": "Abstract\nMindat is the world’s largest open mineral database, featuring over 6,600 mineral species and 430,000 localities. Recently, through NSF and NAIRR support, we have made enhancements to the Mindat open data service by integrating semantic technologies and large language models (LLMs) to improve data quality, usability, and accessibility. We have aligned records with community standards (e.g., rock and mineral nomenclature and classification) and persistent identifiers, which enable FAIR-compliant, machine-readable data access via a new open data API. On top of this infrastructure, LLMs assist with natural-language querying, record cleansing, synonym resolution, and geospatial disambiguation. Embedding-based search and interactive visualizations, such as mineral–element networks and locality heatmaps, allow users to explore data with minimal coding. These innovations reduce barriers to data use, enhance transparency, and support reproducible geoscience research. This work demonstrates how semantic enrichment and LLM tools can transform domain-specific data services into intelligent, user-friendly platforms for data science in the Earth sciences.\n\n\nDate and Time\nAugust 18, 2025, 10:00 - 11:00 AM PDT\n\n\nSpeaker Biography\nXiaogang (Marshall) Ma is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of Idaho.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Foundation models are artificial intelligence (AI) models that are pre-trained on large unlabeled datasets through self-supervision and then fine-tuned for different downstream tasks. There is increasing interest in the scientific community to investigate whether this approach can be successfully applied to domains beyond natural language processing and computer vision to effectively build generalist AI models that make use of different types of data. Here, IBM and NASA present the first end-to-end framework for pre-training and fine-tuning foundation models efficiently from a large source of geospatial data. We have implemented and applied this framework to produce Prithvi, a geospatial foundation model pre-trained on multispectral satellite imagery from the NASA Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel 2 (HLS) dataset. The framework supports automated statistical smart sampling strategies based on whether, land cover and other datasets to maximize impact and minimize waste of resources (e.g. avoiding areas and time ranges that would not bring any new information). Prithvi is a Temporal Vision Transformer that includes positional and temporal embeddings, which was trained on IBM Cloud Vela cluster (NVIDIA A100 GPUs) using a Masked Auto Encoder approach and Mean Squared Error loss function for a total of 10k GPUs hours. We demonstrated using the fine-tuning workflows built in our framework that Prithvi could be successfully fine-tuned to produce state-of-the-art AI models for Earth observation tasks: flood mapping, burn scar identification and multi-temporal crop classification. We carefully studied the impact of Prithvi’s pre-trained weights on the downstream tasks by comparing learning curves for 1) fine-tuning the whole model, 2) fine-tuning only the downstream task decoder, 3) training the model without taking advantage of Prithvi’s pre-trained weights. Furthermore, given the scarcity of labeled data for Earth observation tasks, we progressively decreased the amount of labeled data available for fine-tuning the model to assess data efficiency. This analysis showed that using Prithvi we could achieve peak performance on test data quicker and with less training data (i.e. up to 50% less). Finally, in order to increase the impact of this work, the pre-trained model and fine-tuning workflows have been made publicly available through Hugging Face.\n\nRecording"
