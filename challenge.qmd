# Mapping Retrogressive Thaw Slumps with AI

Welcome to the **GeoAI Challenge**, a competition at the intersection of Geoscience and Artificial Intelligence. We invite you to develop innovative AI models to map retrogressive thaw slumps, a critical indicator of climate change in the Arctic.

## About the Challenge

Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) are landslides that occur in icy permafrost terrain. As the climate warms, these slumps are becoming more frequent and are dramatically reshaping the Arctic landscape. They have a significant impact on the environment, including the release of greenhouse gases.

Mapping RTS is a challenging task due to their dynamic nature, small scale, and often subtle appearance in satellite imagery. This competition challenges you to leverage deep learning and AI to automatically identify and map these important features. By participating, you will contribute to a better understanding of permafrost thaw and its consequences.

## Dataset Samples

The dataset consists of high-resolution satellite imagery paired with corresponding segmentation masks that outline the retrogressive thaw slumps. Your goal is to train a model that can accurately generate these masks from the satellite images.
