Welcome to the **GeoAI Arctic Mapping Challenge**, a competition at the intersection of **Geoscience** and **Artificial Intelligence**. We invite you to develop innovative AI models to map **retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS)**, a critical indicator of climate change in the Arctic.

Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) are dramatic forms of permafrost degradation that occur when ice-rich ground thaws and collapses, often triggered by warming temperatures or surface disturbances. The image above shows a classic example: a headwall of exposed ice retreating upslope, releasing sediment, water, and organic carbon into surrounding landscapes and rivers. These slumps can rapidly expand over time, reshaping terrain and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions as long-frozen carbon is mobilized. For more details on the processes, impacts, and recent advances in detecting RTS using machine learning and satellite imagery, see [this article from Woodwell Climate Research Center](https://permafrost.woodwellclimate.org/using-machine-learning-and-high-resolution-satellite-imagery-to-detect-a-major-greenhouse-gas-emitting-climate-hazard/).



## <span class="material-symbols-outlined">info</span> About the Challenge

Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) are landslides that occur in icy permafrost terrain. As the climate warms, these slumps are becoming more frequent and are dramatically reshaping the Arctic landscape. They have significant environmental impacts, including altering hydrology, affecting ecosystems, and accelerating the release of greenhouse gases.

Mapping RTS is challenging due to their **small size**, **subtle appearance**, and **dynamic evolution** over time. This competition invites you to leverage **deep learning** and **GeoAI** to automatically detect and map these features. By participating, you will contribute to advancing permafrost science and improving our understanding of Arctic change.

The GeoAI Arctic Mapping Challenge builds upon a RTS dataset and cutting-edge multimodal GeoAI models. We encourage participants to cite the following works when using the dataset or baseline model:

### Dataset Source

The dataset was curated by **Yang *et al.* (2023)**, who developed a deep learning approach for mapping RTS from satellite imagery. This dataset forms the foundation of the competition.

### Our Multimodal GeoAI Model

We provide a sample notebook using the baseline model from **Li *et al.* (2025)**, a multi-scale vision transformer-based multimodal GeoAI model that integrates **multi-spectral imagery** and **topographic features** for high-accuracy RTS mapping in Arctic permafrost regions.

## <span class="material-symbols-outlined">image</span> Dataset Samples

The dataset consists of **high-resolution, multi-spectral satellite imagery** paired with segmentation masks outlining RTS boundaries. While the dataset provides **multi-band inputs** (including non-visible spectral channels), the sample images below are displayed using **RGB composites** for visualization purposes only.
