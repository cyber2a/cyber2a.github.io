words from organizers

## Registration & Setup

1. Go to the [CodeBench Challenge Page]().
2. Click **‚ÄúJoin Challenge‚Äù**.
3. Sign in using GitHub, Google, or your institutional email.
4. Accept the **data license agreement** before accessing the dataset.
5. You‚Äôre ready to start! üöÄ

## Download the Dataset

Once registered, you can:

- Download the dataset directly from **CodeBench**.
- Or visit the [Dataset Page](./dataset.qmd) for detailed information and visualizations.

**Dataset Highlights:**

- RGB + Sentinel-2 multi-spectral imagery.
- High-resolution ArcticDEM elevation data.
- COCO-style instance segmentation annotations.

## Data Format

The dataset is organized into **train** and **test** splits with COCO-style annotations:

```bash
dataset/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/              # Multi-band GeoTIFFs
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ masks/               # Per-instance RTS masks
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ annotations.json     # COCO-style labels
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sample_submission.json
```

| **Item**    | **Format** | **Description**                  |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| Imagery     | `.tif`     | Multi-band satellite imagery     |
| Annotations | `.json`    | COCO-style instance segmentation |
| Masks       | `.png`     | Per-instance RTS masks           |

## Baseline Notebook & Starter Kit

We provide a [baseline notebook]() to help you get started quickly.

**Starter Kit Includes:**

- Data loading & visualization examples.
- Baseline multimodal GeoAI model from **Li *et al.* (2025)**.
- Sample inference code.
- Example submission formatting.

## Task Description

Your task is to **predict per-instance RTS masks** using satellite imagery and topographic data.

| Input	| Output |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Multi-band satellite imagery (.tif)	| RTS instance segmentation masks |

## Evaluation Metrics

Submissions are ranked on **CodeBench** using the following metrics:

| Metric	| Definition	| Range	| Higher = Better? |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| mAP	| Mean Average Precision over IoU thresholds	| 0‚Äì1	| ‚úÖ |
| mAP50	| Mean Average Precision over IoU thresholds at 0.5	| 0‚Äì1	| ‚úÖ |
| mAP75	| Mean Average Precision over IoU thresholds at 0.75	| 0‚Äì1	| ‚úÖ |
| mAP-small	| Mean Average Precision over IoU thresholds at 0.5 for small objects	| 0‚Äì1	| ‚úÖ |
| mAP-medium	| Mean Average Precision over IoU thresholds at 0.5 for medium objects	| 0‚Äì1	| ‚úÖ |
| mAP-large	| Mean Average Precision over IoU thresholds at 0.5 for large objects	| 0‚Äì1	| ‚úÖ |

> Primary ranking is based on **mAP**.

## Results Format (Submission Format)

Your submission must follow the **CodeBench COCO-style JSON format**.

**Submission Folder Structure:**

```bash
submission/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ predictions/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image_001.json
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image_002.json
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ submission.json
```

**Example submission.json:**

```json
